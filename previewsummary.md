In this preview, I am showing the first few layers of my project, consisting of a watering can and dead flowers laying in a pool of lava with soft ripples of water peaking through. 
As I explained in my project proposal, my initial vision for this preview included two bouquets of flowers at different life stages depending on the type of environment they lived in: water and sunlight vs darkness. 
However, as I got more familiar with the layering tools of Photoshop, I decided to add more depth to the surroundings of my images by manipulating their backgrounds, changing their opacities, and layering more photos on top of one another. 
At this point, I decided to use an image of lava to represent a toxic physical environment. 
My copy states, “Flowers don’t grow in lava. Neither would your mental health,” to argue that the improvement of mental health won’t occur without self-care. 
By only using one bouquet of flowers instead of a healthy bouquet and a non-healthy bouquet, I’m hoping it will strengthen my argument and that the audience will be able to infer that the flowers would be alive in a vase of water, instead of a pool of lava. 
I really enjoyed playing around with the opacity of each layer. At first, I had the lava replace the water entirely at 100% opacity. 
As I added more layers of water, lowered the opacity, and erased it in some areas like the bottom right corner, it blended together nicely and began to look more realistic. 
I also tried out a few different spots for the text. I don’t know if I will keep it in the bottom left corner, but for now, I used a soft brush tool in white to lighten the rocks underneath the text so it was more visible. 
In my draft, I may try to make the flowers stand out more by reducing some of the lava around the edges or increasing the saturation.
